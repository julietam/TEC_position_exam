## Methodology

### Fermi Estimation Framework

The analysis follows a structured Fermi approach that transparently documents each assumption layer:

1. **Transport Emissions Baseline**: Uses reported transport sector emissions or estimates them as a share of total country emissions based on development level
2. **Vehicle Ownership Modeling**: Infers vehicles per 1,000 people from GDP per capita using global patterns
3. **EV Adoption Translation**: Maps 50% population adoption to EV share of Vehicle-Kilometers Travelled (VKT)
4. **Emissions Intensity Calculation**: Compares ICE vs. EV emissions per kilometer, accounting for grid carbon intensity
5. **Impact Aggregation**: Calculates country and global CO2 reduction estimates

### Key Assumptions and Parameters

#### Vehicle Ownership by Development Level
- **Low income** (GDP < $3,000): 50 vehicles per 1,000 people
- **Lower-middle** ($3,000-$10,000): 150 per 1,000
- **Upper-middle** ($10,000-$30,000): 400 per 1,000  
- **High income** ($30,000+): 600-750 per 1,000

#### Emissions Intensity
- **ICE Vehicles**: 180 gCO2/km (modern fleet global average)
- **EV Energy Use**: 0.18 kWh/km
- **Grid Emission Factors**: 
  - Base formula: 50 + 7.5 × fossil_fuel_percentage (gCO2/kWh)
  - Range: ~50-800 gCO2/kWh depending on energy mix
  - Adjustment: -20 g/kWh for grids >60% renewable (min 30 g/kWh)

#### EV Adoption Translation
The core innovation maps population adoption to transport impact:
```
EV_share_of_VKT = min(1.0, 0.5 / ownership_fraction)
```
Where `ownership_fraction = vehicles_per_1000 / 1000`

This means:
- In high-ownership countries (600+ per 1,000): ~83% of VKT electrified
- In low-ownership countries: 100% VKT electrified (capped)

### Transport Emissions Estimation

For countries missing transport sector data, emissions are estimated as:
- **Low income**: 10% of total emissions
- **Lower-middle**: 12% of total
- **Upper-middle**: 16% of total  
- **High income**: 20% of total
- **Urbanization adjustment**: ±0.05% per percentage point from 50%

### Data Sources and Processing

- **Primary Data**: World Bank processed dataset from Question 1 analysis
- **Time Period**: Latest available year per country (primarily 2020-2021)
- **Coverage**: ~200 countries with emissions and development indicators

## Results

### Global Impact Estimates

The baseline Fermi model estimates:
- **Global Transport Emissions**: 7,152 Mt CO2 annually
- **Total CO2 Reduction**: 2,332 Mt CO2 annually (50% population EV adoption scenario)
- **Percentage of Transport**: 32.6% of transport sector emissions
- **Percentage of Total**: 6.9% of global CO2 emissions

### Top Impact Countries

The analysis identifies countries with the largest absolute CO2 reductions. The top 10 countries by reduction potential are:

1. **United States**: 499 Mt CO2 reduction
2. **China**: 275 Mt CO2 reduction
3. **India**: 118 Mt CO2 reduction
4. **Brazil**: 109 Mt CO2 reduction
5. **Russian Federation**: 72 Mt CO2 reduction
6. **France**: 60 Mt CO2 reduction
7. **Canada**: 60 Mt CO2 reduction
8. **Indonesia**: 57 Mt CO2 reduction
9. **Japan**: 50 Mt CO2 reduction
10. **Germany**: 48 Mt CO2 reduction

These results reflect the model's structure where large economies with significant transport emissions and/or high fossil fuel grid intensity show the greatest potential for EV-driven emissions reductions.

### Regional Patterns

Expected patterns based on the model structure:
- **Developed economies**: Large absolute impacts due to high transport emissions and ownership
- **Emerging markets**: Potentially high EV efficiency gains if grids are coal-heavy
- **Low-income countries**: Limited impact due to low baseline transport emissions

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Parameter Variation

The model tests robustness through sensitivity bands:
- **Grid Carbon Intensity**: ±15 percentage points in fossil fuel share
- **ICE Efficiency**: ±20 gCO2/km from the 180 g/km baseline

These variations provide plausible ranges around the central estimates.

### Key Sensitivities

1. **Grid Decarbonization**: Countries with cleaner electricity grids show higher EV benefits
2. **Vehicle Efficiency**: Assumptions about ICE baseline efficiency significantly affect results
3. **Adoption Patterns**: The mapping from population to VKT share drives impact distribution

## Model Limitations and Considerations

### Fermi Estimation Boundaries

This analysis is explicitly designed as a Fermi estimation for directional insight, not precise forecasting. Key limitations:

1. **Static Relationships**: No modeling of dynamic feedbacks or technological change over time
2. **Aggregation Level**: Country-level averages miss subnational variation in transport patterns
3. **Technology Assumptions**: Fixed EV efficiency and no accounting for vehicle size mix changes
4. **Infrastructure Constraints**: No consideration of charging infrastructure or grid capacity limits
5. **Behavioral Factors**: Simplified adoption model doesn't account for usage pattern changes

### Data Quality Considerations

- Transport sector data availability varies significantly by country
- GDP-based ownership inference may not capture local factors (geography, policy, culture)
- Energy mix data may not reflect actual marginal generation for EV charging

### Policy and Market Context

The model assumes:
- **Policy Neutrality**: Current regulatory frameworks remain unchanged
- **Market Forces**: No explicit modeling of EV cost curves or market dynamics

## Conclusion

This Fermi analysis provides a structured, transparent framework for estimating the global CO2 impact of widespread EV adoption, demonstrating significant potential for transport sector decarbonization. The estimated 2,332 Mt CO2 annual reduction represents 6.9% of global emissions and 32.6% of transport sector emissions, indicating substantial climate benefits from accelerated EV adoption.

The analysis reveals important geographic patterns, with large economies like the United States, China, and India showing the greatest absolute reduction potential, while countries with fossil-heavy electricity grids demonstrate the highest per-vehicle impact. This geographic heterogeneity has important implications for strategic EV deployment and international climate cooperation.

While subject to the inherent limitations of Fermi estimation approaches, the model's strength lies in its explicit documentation of assumptions, systematic sensitivity testing, and appropriate scope for strategic decision-making. The framework provides valuable directional insights for understanding the potential scale and geographic distribution of transport decarbonization opportunities while clearly communicating the boundaries of its applicability.

For policymakers and researchers, this analysis provides a foundation for strategic discussions on EV deployment priorities, international cooperation mechanisms, and the coordination of efforts to decarbonize the transport and electricity sectors. The transparent methodology and comprehensive documentation make it suitable for adaptation to different scenarios and parameter assumptions as the global EV transition evolves.
